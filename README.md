# Raspberry-Pi-Pico-based-Line-Follower-Robot
<strong>Solo Project: Raspberry Pi Pico-Based Line Follower Robot</strong><br><br>
Robots are tools that can ease the burden on humans. Robots can be controlled by humans directly, but actually robots can also make their own decisions if given an intelligent algorithm. The type of robot that is often used in school activities is a wheeled robot. A wheeled robot is a robot that moves by using wheels. The purpose of this project is to get a robot that can recognize lines. This project has been implemented and took approximately 3 days. This robot has been equipped with an infrared sensor of the ``` TCRT5000 ``` type. In the process, this sensor works based on the principle of light reflection obtained from the object which is then forwarded to the phototransistor to determine the output value. If the light reflection on a dark or black object is considered inadequate, the sensor module will provide a ``` LOW ``` output, in which case the LED indicator will not light up. If the light reflection on a bright or white surface is considered adequate, the sensor module will provide a ``` HIGH ``` output, in which case the LED indicator will light up. The benefit of making this project is none other than to add insight. The results showed that the system made can function properly.

## MicroPython Bootloader Setup
1. ``` Upload the firmware ``` :

   <table><tr><td width="810">      

      - Press and hold the ``` BOOTSEL ``` button on the ``` Raspberry Pi Pico ``` board while connecting to the computer via a ``` micro USB ``` cable.
   
      - After the ``` Raspberry Pi Pico ``` is recognized by the computer (connected), then immediately release the ``` BOOTSEL ``` button.
      
      - When successfully connected, a new drive called ``` RPI-RP2 ``` will open.
      
      - ``` Drag -> Drop ``` or ``` Copy -> Paste ``` the ``` MicroPython UF2 ``` firmware file into the ``` RPI-RP2 ``` drive.

   </td></tr></table><br>

2. After the process is successful, the ``` RPI-RP2 ``` drive will automatically close.<br><br>

3. In general, the firmware upload only needs to be done once when you first use the ``` Raspberry Pi Pico ``` board.

<br><br>

## Thonny IDE Setup
1. Open ``` Thonny IDE ``` first.<br><br>

2. Click ``` Tools ``` -> then select ``` Options... ``` -> then select :<br><br>
   
   • ``` Interpreter Menu ```, then change the part :

      <table><tr><td width="810">
      
      - ``` Interpreter ``` -> ``` MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico) ```
        
      - ``` Port ``` -> ``` Board CDC @ COM... ```
  
      - ``` Restart interpreter before running a script ``` -> ``` uncheck ```

      </td></tr></table>
   
   • ``` Editor Menu ```, then check all the options except: ``` Indent with tab characters ```.<br><br>

3. If the file view does not exist in ``` Thonny IDE ```, then please click the ``` View ``` -> section and select ``` Files ``` to display it.<br><br>

4. Then look for a file called ``` main.py ``` in directory: ``` Raspberry-Pi-Pico-based-Line-Follower-Robot/Src ```.<br><br>
   
5. Right click on the file -> select ``` Upload to / ```.<br><br>

6. Open the file ``` main.py ``` which is in the ``` Raspberry Pi Pico ``` storage -> then click ``` Run current script (F5) ```.<br><br>

7. Program code executed successfully -> sign: ``` %run -c $EDITOR_CONTENT ```.<br><br>

8. If there is still a problem when uploading the program, then try to check the ``` interpreter ``` / ``` port ``` / ``` others ``` section.

<br><br>
